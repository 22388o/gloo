# Introduction

Welcome to the Gloo Guide, an introductory guide about [Gloo](https://github.com/rustwasm/gloo).
Gloo is a toolkit for building web applications and libraries with Rust and Wasm, composed of 
modular crates. [Gloo crates](https://github.com/rustwasm/gloo/tree/master/crates)
include example code, both in their respective `example` folders, and commented in their code, as well
as [API documentation](https://docs.rs/gloo/). The purpose of this guide is to complement these 
by providing narritive description, 
and step-by-step of how to use Gloo and its crates.
 
This guide assumes familiarity with the [Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org/), and web programming. 
If you'd like to learn Rust,
check out the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html). The [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
is a good reference for web programming.
